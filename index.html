                There's more visual freedom in parallax website design.
                Rather than focusing on block style information architecture, you can create 
                refreshin and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful 
                photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page.

                Mobiles and Tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It's now les about clicking 
                and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping.
                Long scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation, 
                provding a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.

                Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor
                website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their 
                message and vision into one dynamic web page design.

            <div class="content-p">
                These days, scrolling is so smple that it's become an
                instinctive action, whereas clicking through another page requires
                thought and motivation. A single page website allows user to identify thier purpose on the 
                website quicker, than needing to go through multiple pages.

                YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY
            </div>
            <div class="content-p">
                One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that
                they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of 
                pages of your website, Google has fewer pages to index and negatively
                impacts your standing on the search engine results page (SERP).
                Luckily there are ways around this.

            <div class="content-p">
                50% of website users bouce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the 
                more high resolution imagery and and animations you include, the longer it takes to
                load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popula parallax websites, and found that the
                ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites loaded within a few seconds.

                AWKWARD NAVIGATION
            </div>
            <div class="content-p">
                Instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back up the page which 
                can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain element.
                An easy way around this is to include top navigation and have each elemment anchored to a category or selection.
